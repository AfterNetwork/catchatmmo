Project CatChat - MMO Game inspired by Club Penguin

This is the official github repository for the CatChat MMO.

Currently, the only working build of the game can be found on Scratch. It is called "CatChat: Scratch Edition".
See https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/297258424/ for the project.

The "CatChat: Godot Edition" is currenly in 'Alpha stage', and is not ready for public testing.



I made a demo game, called "TheButton.exe". It's a simple clicker.

The only few useable items in this game is the scene loader scripts and the texturebuttons.
